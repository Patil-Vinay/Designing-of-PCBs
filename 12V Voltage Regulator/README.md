# 12V Voltage Regulator
 A voltage regulator is a component of the power supply unit that ensures a steady constant voltage supply through all operational conditions. It regulates voltage during power fluctuations and variations in loads. We used a LM7812 for this purpose and this is also commonly used linear regulator.
