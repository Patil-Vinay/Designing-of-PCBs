# Designing-of-PCBs
A printed circuit board, or PCB, is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.
I have developed various PCB's such as voltage regulator, led boards and many more. 
Some of the PCBs are single layer and some of them are multi-layer.
