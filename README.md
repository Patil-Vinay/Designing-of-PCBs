# Designing-of-PCBs
A printed circuit board, or PCB, is used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways, tracks or signal traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. A PCB can be single layer, double layer or multi-layer.
I have developed PCB's for various applications like voltage regulator, led boards and many more, some of the PCBs are single layer and some of them are multi-layer.
